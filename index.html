        <h2>Build a Career Not a GET RICH QUICK Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Today, I had the chance to apply for an internship at the British High
          Commission office in Nigeria. It came with an attractive salary and
          benefits, but I chose to let it pass. Reading through the job
          requirements, I realized I was overqualified—holding a master’s degree
          for a role that demanded far less. Yet, what struck me wasn’t the
          opportunity itself, but the clarity it brought about my goals. I’ve
          resolved to build a career in software development, one rooted in
          purpose and long-term impact. As I reflected, the words of Oyedepo
          echoed in my mind: <br />
          <strong>
            “You will not find a story of outstanding success without a story of
            sacrifice behind it.”
          </strong>
          <br />
          Building a career isn’t about chasing the highest paycheck; it’s about
          investing in skills, embracing growth, and staying true to a vision
          that transcends immediate gains. Then, the paychecks will inevitably
          roll in, as money flows in the direction of value.
